# Involys-DataIntegration-Tool
A parametrized (C#.net) tool to exchange and integrate data into/from Involys (CESC) ERPs with other systems, through SQL Server and Oracle DBMS

The work entrusted to me is the design and development of an application that
manages data sharing between INVOLYS systems and external systems. My goal was to
create a tool that will allow to parameterize and to adapt the interfacing procedures
via an intermediary database and Excel canvas arrested between INVOLYS and the
other companies.
This project is written in C # language, .Net Framework 4.0 and under the two DBMS
(MSSQLSERVER and Oracle).
